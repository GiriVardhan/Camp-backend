CocoaOwl Desktop Folder Sync is a java program that needs to run on client machine.

Right now, this client program assumes that the CocoaOwl server is running at localhost with port number 8080 and client is testclient.

Client program dependent jars can be found under Libs directory.

Running the client program will create a "CocoaOwl" directory in client machine under user's home directory and synchronizes CocoaOwl folders and files there.

Note : Folder and file names must be AlphaNumeric only, no special characters allowed as of now.


As this feature need updates in CocoaOwl server DB, this has to be tested on a CocoaOwl database setup done after 20-Feb-2016.






In phase 1 client program is able to synchronize the below cases :


Case 1 : New folders, new subfolders, new files on server to client.
Case 2 : New folders, new subfolders, new files on client to server.
Case 3 : Delete Folders, subfolders , files on server to client.
Case 4 : Delete Folders, subfolders, files on client to server.
Case 5 : Edit files on client to server, as files are not editable on server as of now.
